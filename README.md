The magic world is a virtual world where there are various characters who live their own lives and change the world itself.

# Begin
The first step is to launch the world:
`go run cmd/main.go`

Next, you need to launch the world viewer. After launching, go to the following address in your browser http://127.0.0.1:8080/test.world:
`go run cmd/viewer/main.go`

Now this world is no good, and the idea is stupid. But I am sure that if I do not lose the desire to develop this product, something interesting will turn out.
